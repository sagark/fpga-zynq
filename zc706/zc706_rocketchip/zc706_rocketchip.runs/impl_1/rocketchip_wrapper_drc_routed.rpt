-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

Synchronous clocking for BRAM (top/RocketTile/dcache/meta/tag_arr/ram_reg_0) in SDP mode with Write First mode may have address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports. It is suggested to simulate the design to determine if any possible address collisions could exist in the design.  If so it is suggested to evaluate ways to eliminate the collisions or you may change the write mode to Read First which may reduce some performance and consume more power however will delay the writing thus resolving any potential collisions.
